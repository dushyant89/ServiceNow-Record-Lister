This project is about listing important records in *servicenow* in a chrome extension. The type of records listed in the extension are as below
* Problem Tasks
* Knowledge Articles
* Stories
* Tasks
* Fix Targets

## How does it works
* After you have installed the extension go to any page on service-now.com, let's say hi.service-now.com or any of the nightly instances as well.
* Click on the extension and a pop-up will appear.
* In the log-in form inside the popup, enter the credentials which are used to login to *hi.service-now.com* or the specific instance being used.
* Once logged in the extension will list the different records which are there on the page with some metadata for each type of record.

## Note
The extension only works if the domain is *servicenow-now.com (obviously).
